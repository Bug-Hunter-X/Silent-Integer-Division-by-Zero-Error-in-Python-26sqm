This repository demonstrates a subtle and uncommon error in Python: an integer division by zero that's masked by conditional logic. The bug.py file contains the flawed function, and the bugSolution.py file offers a corrected version with comprehensive error handling.  This is a great example to illustrate the importance of thorough testing and robust error handling practices in Python.
